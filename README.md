This is my portifolio in which I have outlined my projects as a software developer.
The portifolio project is a HTML project that does not rquire any installation. The project uses both custom css and online css to make it beautiful.
the online css is from https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700,900.
You need to have a browser which you open the portifolio.html with and thats all.

As of now, the portifolio project does not require any licences and can be shared as is or modified.
